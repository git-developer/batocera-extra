Extended motion and touch control for batocera
:toc: preamble
:toclevels: 4

This project is a proof of concept to play games with motion and touch control in the retro gaming distribution {url-batocera}[batocera].

## Project status

This project should be considered experimental. It demonstrates how motion and touch control can be added to batocera.
Currently, some ugly hacks are required to achieve this. Installation requires command line access to batocera through a SSH shell. Main goal of this project is to properly integrate the features into the core of batocera in the future.

The project is tested against the x86_64 platform. There are no hard dependencies on this architecture, so it may well
run on other architectures, too, but this is currently untested.

## Installation

. Open a shell on the batocera host
.. either via SSH
.. or by pressing F1 in the main menu to open the file manager and then F4 to open a terminal
. Copy this directory to `/userdata/extra` to your batocera host:
+
[source,console]
----
$ mkdir -p /userdata/extra && wget -O - https://github.com/git-developer/batocera-extra/tarball/main | gunzip | tar x --strip-components 1 -C /userdata/extra
----
. Add the following line to your `/userdata/system/custom.sh`:
+
[source]
----
/userdata/extra/bin/extra-setup "${@}" 2>&1 | tee /userdata/system/logs/extra-setup.log
----
. Follow the installation instructions of the features you're interested in.
.. Each feature has its own subdirectory containing a README file.
.. By default, all features are installed to disk and registered as batocera-service, but not enabled.
   To exclude a feature, run `/userdata/extra/<feature>/service hide`.

### Scripts
Scripts are located in the `bin/` directory.

#### `extra-setup`
* Setup script that enables patches and prepares features of this project. It must be included in `/userdata/system/custom.sh`.

#### `extra-services`
* Script to manually manage the features of this project. You normally don't have to use this script, but it may be useful when something goes wrong.

#### `on-game-condition`
* A template for files in the `/userdata/system/scripts` directory.

#### `read-temperatures`
* A script to read system temperatures.

#### `squash-mount`
* A script to simplify (un)mounting squashfs roms for one or all systems to subdirectories of `/var/run/squashfs`.

#### `system-summary`
* A script to create a system summary (cpu, memory). May be bound to a key or controller button, e.g.:
+
./userdata/system/configs/multimedia_keys.conf
[source.conf]

## Emulator configuration for motion and touch control
This section explains the emulator configuration that is required to play games with motion and touch control. This configuration has to be performed once only, it will be persisted across boots and batocera updates.

The configuration generators for Cemu and Citra in current batocera don't offer support for motion and touch control. Thus, the included patches are required.

Once the configuration is applied, the emulators will behave as follows:

* Touch input is read from the emulator window. This enables the following sources for touch input:
** The touchpad of a DS4 or DS5 controller
** A smartphone connected via remote touchpad
** A mouse connected to the batocera host

* Motion input is read from a cemuhook server.
** For a controller connected to motion_evdev, use `localhost` and `26766`.
** For a Nintendo controller connected to motion_nintendo, use `localhost` and `26761`.
** For a DS4 or DS5 controller connected to motion_sony, use `localhost` and `26762`.
** For a Wiimote connected to motion_wiimote, use `localhost` and the port from your linuxmotehook2 configuration file.
** For a Steam Deck connected to motion_steam_deck, use `localhost` and `26767`.
** For a Steam Controller connected to motion_steam_controller, use `localhost` and `26760`.
** For a smartphone, use the hostname/ip of the smartphone and the port configured in the app of your choice (e.g. _MotionSource_ or _DSUController_).

### Citra
./userdata/system/batocera.conf
----
3ds.citra_motion_device=engine:cemuhookudp
3ds.citra_touch_device=engine:emu_window
3ds.citra_udp_input_address=localhost
3ds.citra_udp_input_port=26766
----

Notes:

* The settings may be set by editing the configuration file using a text editor.
* Without patching the Citra configuration generator, these settings have no effect.
* Implementation details:
** Without patch, the generator uses the SDL controller API without (working) motion support.
** The patch reads the settings from `batocera.conf` and adds them to the controller configuration files in `/userdata/system/configs/citra-emu/qt-config.ini`.

### Cemu
./userdata/system/batocera.conf
----
wiiu.cemuhook_server_ip=localhost
wiiu.cemuhook_server_port=26766
----

Notes:

* The settings must be set by editing the configuration file using a text editor.
* Without patching the Cemu configuration generator, these settings have no effect.
* Implementation details:
** Without patch, the generator uses the SDL controller API without (working) motion support.
** The patch reads the settings from `batocera.conf` and adds them to the controller configuration files in `/userdata/system/configs/cemu/controllerProfiles/controller*.xml`.
