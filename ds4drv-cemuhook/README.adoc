Motion and touch control for Sony DualShock 4 controllers

This directory contains files to install and manage {url-ds4drv-cemuhook}[ds4drv-cemuhook] which enables motion and touch control for Sony DualShock 4 controllers. Controllers may be connected via USB or Bluetooth.

== Installation
. Add `install-and-start` to your `/userdata/system/custom.sh`. This will perform the following steps when the host boots:

.. Prepare `pip`, if required.
.. Download the latest version of `ds4drv-cemuhook` to `download`, if required.
.. Install it via `pip`.
.. Start it as background daemon.

== Usage
Configure your emulators to listen to `localhost` port `26762`. The https://github.com/joaorb64/joycond-cemuhook/wiki[joycond-cemuhook wiki] has detailed explanations for popular emulators.

NOTE: The default port for the cemuhook protocol is `26760`. The custom port `26762` was chosen to avoid conflicts with other cemuhook servers. It is configurable in the `.env` file.

NOTE: Please pay attention to the patches for Citra and Cemu in this project, they are required when you'd like to run the emulators from ES.

== Troubleshooting
* The log file is located at `/userdata/system/logs/ds4drv-cemuhook.log` (location is configurable in the `.env` file).
* The other scripts (e.g. `is-up`, `stop`) may help to analyse problems, their names should be self-explaining.

== Implementation details
Under the hood, https://github.com/chrippa/ds4drv[ds4drv] uses `hcitool` for bluetooth management which is deprecated (see https://github.com/chrippa/ds4drv/issues/123[ds4drv #123] for details). `ds4drv-cemuhook` calls `hcitool clock` to check if bluetooth is up and running. This command returns an `Input/output error` on some machines although bluetooth is working fine. To workaround this, the script `quirk/hcitool` is used to simply ignore this single call and delegate everything else to the `hcitool`.
